# iOS Tech Challenge: What to eat. 

Welcome to the Orderbird Tech Challenge :-).

"What to eat" is an app that helps you find some food on days where you are doubting what to bring to your stomach.

It has a simple table view, which fetches images from flickr API service, and populates a title and description label in the UI.
Unfortunately one of our developers had introduced some bugs by accident and we hope that you can help to find and fix them.

**Bug Fixes:**
First task would be to implement some bug fixes some of which are minor UI cosmetics and some which may be of a more serious nature and impact performance.
We also noticed that the text within the cells seems to be truncated, would be nice to have this fixed also.


**New Feature requirements:**
We would like you to add the ability to present a detail view of a tapped image cell to display a bigger more detailed image from the API with more details and text.
Ideally this would envolve pushing to a new ViewController.

We also think that it would be nice to have the ability to sort the images by Date, perhaps this could displayed in a UISegmentedControl or have some toggle component.

Finally a re-write of the Networking layer in Swift 4 (or latest) would be required & add unit tests for the new module.

Some guidelines:

- Showcase your abilities, and use the task to demonstrate your idea of best practices, regarding coding style, project structure, patterns, design, etc.
- Don't use third party libraries.
- please do not rewrite the app completely in SWIFT ;-) (as we are more curious on how you work with the objective C codebase)
- There is no right or wrong solution, as long as it is your solution.
- If you only have time to do one thing please do it as good as you possible can. It is better to have a nice but incomplete solution rather than a mediocre "feature complete" one. We want to get a good impression of your abilities.
- Be prepared to describe your work in detail.
